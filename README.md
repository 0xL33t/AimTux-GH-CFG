My AimTux Grenade Helper Configs

Here are my [AimTux](https://github.com/AimTuxOfficial/AimTux) Grenade Helper Configs. I hope they'll improve your gameplay experience. I'll be updating them in my spare time since they are no way complete. 

# Installation
1. Go to ~/.config/AimTuxGH/
2. Copy all the files to there (or the ones you want to use).
3. Enter a map, enable Grenade Helper.
4. Profit $$$
